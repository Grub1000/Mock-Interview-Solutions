# ðŸ“Œ Mock Interview Problem: Word Frequency Counter
# Problem Statement:
# Write a program that takes a paragraph of text as input and returns the top 3 most frequent words along with their counts.

# Words should be case-insensitive.

# Ignore punctuation.

# If there are fewer than 3 unique words, return all of them.

# Example Input:
# "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog was not amused."

#Expected Output:
# the: 3
# dog: 2
# quick: 1


# Constraints:
# Assume input will be a single paragraph (string).
# You may use built-in libraries for string manipulation.
# Must run efficiently for up to 10,000 words.
